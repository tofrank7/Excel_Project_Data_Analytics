# Excel Salary Dashboard

## Introduction

This data jobs salary dashboard was created to help job seekers, like myself, investigate salaries for their desired jobs and ensure they are being compensated fairly.

The dataset was provided by Luke Barousse as part of his Excel for Data Analytics course. It contains real-world salary data for a variety of data-related roles, including information on job titles, average annual salaries, countries, work schedules, and essential skills.

The goal of this project was to analyze this dataset and design a functional, interactive dashboard using Excel—equipping users with the ability to filter salary insights by role, location, and job type.
